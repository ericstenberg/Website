		<h2>About This Website</h2>
		<p>This website is my first foray into web development and I'm not entirely sure where we go from here, but I have some ideas. It could be a blog, a learning tool, a template (it is open source after all), or maybe something completely different. Foremost, I want it to be something useful; a place where any visitor whether they be a novice or an expert can take away something valuable.</p>
